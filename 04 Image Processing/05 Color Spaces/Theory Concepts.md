1. The RGB color space is an additive color space, where a specific color is
represented by red, green, and blue values. Human vision works in a similar
way, so this color space is an appropriate way to display computer graphics.
2. The CIELAB color space (also known as CIE L*a*b* or simply LAB)


represents a specific color as three numerical values, where L* represents the
lightness, a* represents the green-red components, and b* represents the
blue-yellow components. This color space is also used in some image
processing algorithms.

3. Hue, saturation, lightness (HSL) and hue, saturation, value (HSV) are
two color spaces, where only one channel (H) is used to describe the color,
making it very intuitive to specify the color. In these color models, the
separation of the luminance component has some advantages when applying
image processing techniques.

4. YCbCr is a family of color spaces used in video and digital photography
systems, representing colors in terms of the chroma components (Y) and two
chrominance components/chroma (Cb and Cr). This color space is very
popular in image segmentation, based on the color model derived from the
YCbCr image.
