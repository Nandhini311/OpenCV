### Construction Basic Shapes in OpenCV

      When building a computer vision project, you usually want to modify the image by drawing some shapes. 
      For example, if you develop a face detection algorithm, you should draw a rectangle highlighting 
      the detected faces in the computed image.       
      
The following topics will be covered in this module:
1. A theoretical introduction to drawing in OpenCV
2. Basic shapes—lines, rectangles, and circles
3. Basic shapes (2)—clip and arrowed lines, ellipses, and polylines
4. Drawing text
5. Dynamic drawing with mouse events
6. Advanced drawing
